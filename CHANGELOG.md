## [1.2.4] — 2026-03-30

### Changed

- **Analytics** — 404 errors now sorted by most recent first; default date range changed from 30 to 7 days; "Top pages" and "Device types" panels stack vertically on mobile; "Last seen" column is right-aligned

---

## [1.2.3] — 2026-03-29

### Changed

- **Code simplification** — migration loop, settings helpers, query patterns, slug generation, syndication logic, and build calls consolidated for clarity and consistency
- **Standardised output escaping** — `dashboard.php` and `analytics.php` now use `Helpers::e()` consistently with the rest of the admin
- **page-edit delete handler** — moved before save block so delete action is reachable (was previously unreachable)

### Fixed

- **XSS** — `$post->status` and `$page->status` now escaped with `Helpers::e()` in badge output
- **Session cookie `secure` flag** — now also set when behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy via `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO`
- **WebAuthn rpId** — derived from canonical `site_url` setting instead of attacker-controllable `HTTP_HOST` header
- **Migration seed SQL injection** — settings seed now uses a prepared statement instead of string interpolation
- **DNS rebinding (Mastodon SSRF)** — hostname resolved immediately before curl connects and pinned via `CURLOPT_RESOLVE`

---

## [1.2.2] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Analytics timezone** — daily chart grouping, chart axis labels, and 404 "last seen" timestamps now respect the timezone configured in Settings instead of always using UTC

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- **Built-in analytics beacon** — `track.php` at the web root accepts `navigator.sendBeacon` POST requests with `{url, referrer, is404}` JSON; no cookies or third-party services used
- **`page_views` database table** (schema v13) — stores url, referrer, device_type, is_404, ip_hash, and timestamp; auto-migrates on boot
- **IP privacy** — client IP addresses are stored as HMAC-SHA256 hashes using a server-side salt; raw IPs are never persisted
- **Rate limiting** — PHP-level limit of 30 requests/minute per IP in `track.php`; Nginx `limit_req_zone` at 2 r/s with burst 20 in `location = /track.php`
- **Analytics dashboard** (`admin/analytics.php`) — Chart.js graphs for views/day, top pages, device breakdown, and referrers; 404 error table; 7/30/90-day range selector; owner opt-out URL shown
- **Chart.js 4.4.7** vendored locally at `admin/assets/chart.min.js` — no external CDN dependency
- **Beacon JS in public templates** — `templates/base.php` now includes a small inline script that fires `sendBeacon` on page load; visit `/?ti=exclude` to set a localStorage opt-out flag, `/?ti=include` to re-enable
- **404 tracking** — `templates/404.php` sets an `analyticsIs404` flag so 404 hits are recorded separately in the dashboard
- **Automatic data pruning** — `admin/bootstrap.php` deletes `page_views` rows older than 90 days on ~1% of admin requests
- **Nginx config for beacon** — `docker/nginx.conf` and `nginx.conf.example` both include a `location = /track.php` block with `limit_req`, `limit_except POST`, `client_max_body_size 4k`, and security headers
